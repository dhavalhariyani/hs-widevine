<h2 align=center>LeakKernelDeint Plugin for Avisynth 2.5<br>
(Version 1.5.4)</h2>

<h3 align=center>by Kurt B. Pr&uuml;nner<br>
(based on KernelDeint 1.4.0 by Donald Graft)</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This filter deinterlaces using a kernel approach.
It gives greatly improved vertical resolution in deinterlaced areas compared to
simple field discarding.
</p>

<p>
If you set the threshold to 0, you can get totally artifact free
results (due to lack of thresholding) but with much less loss of vertical resolution than
simple field discarding. For optimal results, however, set a motion threshold that
allows static areas of the picture to be passed through. In this mode, the kernel-based
deinterlacing of the moving areas preserves their vertical resolution compared to simple
interpolation.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this version contains a function named LeakKernelBob() (adapted from
Scharfis_brain's script of the same name) that does full framerate deinterlacing,
i.e. it turn 50 fields per second into 50 frames per second.
</p>

<p>
The filter accepts RGB32, YUY2, or YV12 input.
</p>

<p>
To use this filter as a post-processor for Telecide(), use the following script:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
	Telecide(...,post=1,hints=true)
	LeakKernelDeint(...)
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Function Syntax</h3>

<p>
LeakKernelDeint() and LeakKernelBob() take the following named parameters:
</p>

<p>
<b><i>order</i></b> (0-1, default none!) This parameter defines the field order of the clip. It is
very important to set this correctly. Use order=0 for bottom field first (bff). Use order=1 for top field
first (tff). You must specify order; LeakKernelDeint throws an exception if you omit this parameter.
</p>

<p>
It is essential to set the field order properly for correct rendering. Because setting
it correctly is so important, you are strongly encouraged not to make assumptions about
the field order of a clip, but rather to verify the field order using the following procedure.
</p>

<p>
To determine the field order, make an Avisynth script that serves the raw clip without any
processing. If it were an AVI, then just AviSource() would be used. For our examples, we'll
use AviSource(). Add a script line to separate the fields using top field first, as follows:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
AviSource("your_clip.avi")
AssumeTFF().SeparateFields()
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now serve the script into VirtualDub and find an area with motion. Single step forward through
the motion. Note whether the motion progresses always forward as it should, or whether it jumps
back and forth as it proceeds. For example, if the field order is wrong,
an object moving steadily from left to right would move right, then jump back left a little, then
move right again, etc. If the field order is correct, it moves steadily to the right.
</p>

<p>
If the motion is correct with AssumeTFF().SeparateFields(), then your field order is top
field first and you must set order=1. If the motion is incorrect, then your field order is
bottom field first and you must set order=0. If you are want to double check things, you can use
AssumeBFF.SeparateFields() to check correct operation for bottom field first.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>threshold</i></b> (0-255, default 10) This parameter defines the "motion" threshold. Moving
areas are kernel-deinterlaced while non-moving areas are passed through. Use the <i>map</i>
parameter to tweak the <i>threshold</i> parameter so that just the combed areas of the frame
are deinterlaced.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>sharp</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter, when set to true, selects a kernel
that provides better vertical resolution and performs some sharpening of the video. For less sharpening
but also less vertical resolution, set this parameter to false.</p>
</p>

<p>
<b><i>twoway</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter, when set to true, selects a kernel
that includes both the previous and the following fields for deinterlacing. When set to false, the
kernel includes only the previous field. The latter one-way kernel is faster, crisper, and gives
less blending (this last advantage makes the filter perform better on anime). The <i>twoway</i>
parameter is included in case users want to achieve the behavior of previous versions.</p>
</p>

<p>
<b><i>map</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter, when set to true, shows the areas that
are "moving" as determined by the <i>threshold</i> parameter and which will be kernel-deinterlaced. Use this
parameter to assist in tweaking the <i>threshold</i> parameter.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>linked</i></b> (true/false, default false; YV12/YUY2 only) This parameter, when set to true, links the motion
masks of the chroma and luma planes so deinterlacing will take place in the same spots on both planes. Use it if you
still get residual artifacts in only partially deinterlaced areas, but most of the chroma artifacts of version 1.4.0
were eliminated by using a combined motion map for both chroma planes, thus the default of false. You probably also
don't want to set this to true if your video has severe rainbowing, as it will deinterlace the luma plane in those spots
thus degrading video quality more than any (other) chroma artifacts could.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>debug</i></b> (true/false, default false) This parameter, when set to true, enables debug ouput via the
DebugView utility. Currently, it shows the version number of the filter and, if hints are present from
Telecide(), whether frame are hinted as progressive or interlaced. If hints are not present, the
debug output shows all frames as interlaced. Also, you'll get a hint if your frames have different pitches which
will disable the MMX optimizations, even though I'm not sure if this can even happen in AviSynth.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>forceCPU</i></b> (0-5, default 0) This parameter forces the filter to only use specific optimizations:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>0 ... autodetect</li>
<li>1 ... C++ code only</li>
<li>2 ... Use MMX code where available</li>
<li>3 ... Use MMX & Integer SSE code where available</li>
<li>4 ... Use MMX & SSE code where available</li>
<li>5 ... Use MMX & SSE & SSE2 code where available</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>NB:</b> since the code currently only uses MMX, using a value higher than 2 won't result in a speedup.
