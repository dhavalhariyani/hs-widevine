		<h1>FluxSmooth</h1>
		<h3>An Avisynth filter for smoothing of fluctuations</h3>
		<p><b>By Ross Thomas &lt;ross@grinfinity.com&gt;</b></p>
		<p><b>There is no copyright on this code, and there are no conditions on its 
				distribution or use. Do with it what you will.</b></p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>One of the fundamental properties of noise is that it's random. One of the 
			fundamental properties of motion is that it's not. This is the premise behind 
			FluxSmooth, which examines each pixel and compares it to the corresponding 
			pixel in the previous and last frame. Smoothing occurs if both the previous 
			frame's value and the next frame's value are greater, or if both are less, than 
			the value in the current frame.</p>
		<p>I like to call this a "fluctuating" pixel, then I like to wipe that pixel from 
			existence by averaging it with its neighbours. For FluxSmoothST, this 
			is&nbsp;(by default) done in a spatio-temporal manner, in that for each 
			fluctuating pixel its 8 immediate spatial neighbours as well as its 2 temporal 
			neighbours (the abovementioned corresponding pixel from the previous and next 
			frames) are considered for inclusion in the average. If the value of each pixel 
			is within the specified threshold, it is included. If not, it isn't. 
			FluxSmoothT performs only temporal averaging.</p>
		<p>This filter seems to remove almost all noise from low-noise sources (such as 
			DVD) and a lot of noise from high-noise sources (such as cable TV captures), 
			while maintaining a good amount of detail.</p>
		<p>If your CPU supports integer SSE operations (Intel Pentium III and better, AMD 
			Athlon and better) an optimized version of the algorithm will be used.</p>
		<P>Using FluxSmoothT instead of FluxSmoothST for temporal-only smoothing is much, 
			much faster (50% faster on my system).</P>
		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<P>FluxSmoothT([clip], int <I>temporal_threshold</I>)</P>
			<P>FluxSmoothST([clip], int <i>temporal_threshold</i>, int <i>spatial_threshold</i>)</P>

		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			The very edges of the frame are unprocessed.
			<li>
			The very first and very last frame of a clip is unprocessed.
			<LI>
				Appears to cause an access violation when used with n-pass encoding in CCE. 
				I've been unable to duplicate this. Might've been related to the memory leak 
				fixed by fabrice.</LI>
		</ul>
		<h2>TODO</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Optimize SSE code with regard to pairing, stalls, and so on.</li>

			<tr>
				<th>
					Version</th>
				<th>
					Description</th>
			</tr>
			<TR>
				<TD>1.1b</TD>
				<TD>Fixed assuming previous and next frame pitches were the same as
					the current frame pitch.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>1.1a</TD>
				<TD>Yet another "oops" release. Current pixel is once again considered in the 
					averaging code -- I found the lack of it too aggressive, especially during fast 
					motion. Also fixed stupid "3am bug" involving a couple of variables I'd 
					declared static that shouldn't've been. Thanks to krieger2005 for spotting that 
					one, and ARDA for diagnosing it.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>1.1</TD>
				<TD>Changed the averaging code so that the current pixel is excluded, which 
					produces better noise reduction. Also split the code into two different 
					filters, FluxSmoothT and FluxSmoothST. The former does temporal-only smoothing 
					(equivalent to setting "spatial_threshold=-1" in&nbsp;FluxSmoothST) and is 
					about 50% faster. Removed&nbsp;Avisynth 2.0x version to tidy up the code base. 
					Does anyone actually use it any more? My thanks to fabrice and sh0dan for the 
					1.01 release during my extended absence&nbsp;:).</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>1.01</TD>
				<TD>Added by sh0dan:<br>
					- Removed leak in AviSynth 2.5 YV12 mode (code by fabrice)<br>
					- Aligned tables and variables.<br>
					- Use AviSynth BitBlt for copying chroma.<br>
					- Don't use streaming store. (movntq)<br>
					All in all an approximate 15% speedup compared to previous version. All changes 
					are marked with "sh0:".</TD>
			<TR>
				<TD>1.0</TD>
				<TD>First "stable" release. I think it's been tested enough, but wait for a bunch 
					of bugs to emerge and make me a liar... Fixed a bug that, in conjunction with a 
					bug in the built-in resizers, caused an access violation under certain 
					circumstances. Thanks to sh0dan for spotting that one :). Added "SetCacheHints" 
					and upgraded to "AvisynthPluginInit2" in 2.5 version.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>0.4</TD>
				<TD>Implemented iSSE-optimized version, which runs roughly double the speed of the 
					C++ version. Some small optimizations to C++ version. Now smooths chroma as 
					well as luma.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>0.3</TD>
				<TD>Fixed bad bug that caused incorrect smoothing: no more in-place filtering. 
					Changed defaults back to what they were, now that the algorithm works 
					correctly.&nbsp;Spent some time benchmarking and tweaking various pieces of 
					code, so should now be significantly faster.</TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<td>0.2</td>
				<td>
					<p>Fixed non-fatal bug that caused a request for one frame beyond the end of the 
						clip. Changed to in-place filtering so could squeeze a few optimizations here 
						and there. Changed too-high defaults. First Avisynth 2.5/YV12 release.</p>

			<tr>
				<td>0.1</td>
