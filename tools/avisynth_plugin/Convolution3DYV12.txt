Specific information about Convolution3d for Avisynth 2.5
for all "normal" release see at http://hellninjacommando.com/con3d/

Know problem : 
	- works only with YV12
	- Temporal influence currently disabled.

Todo :
	- Add some thread (for MaTTer ;)))) (DONE)
	- correct some of the known problem ....

Big thanks to Sh0dan for this huge work, all avisynth filter developper owe you a lot.
Big thanks to MaTTeR for the beta test he did with SMP & C3D.


Changelog :

2003/03/29 Beta 5 :
	- Reorganize all the code : it should be easier to maintain and also faster
	- Maybe other thing I forgot :(

2003/01/01 Beta 4 :
	- Change AvisynthPluginInit to AvisynthPluginInit2

2003/01/01 Beta 4 Test :
	- New optimizations (works on byte instead of words)
	- Rewrite a lot of the macros to simplify the code
	- Added some debug output to show the SMP status
	- If debug parameter = -2 -> Force SMP use
	- If debug parameter = -1 -> Disable SMP use
	- Added new fast mode with 11 check point only (instead of 27) :
		If matrix = 2 -> Fast orginal matrix (121)
		if matrix = 3 -> Fast simple matrix (111)
	- Fix some problem on non mod-4 width 	

2002/11/30 Beta 3 :
	- Added little optimization on threshold checks
	- Should now work with any mod2 width
	- Checked some potential rounding problems
	- added basic filtering to border pixels
	- added case insensitive presets (for Sh0dan !)

2002/11/16 Beta 2 :
	- Added SMP optimizations (Thanks to MaTTeR for the beta test, +2~4 fps for him).
	- Reorganize a little the code (new .h files)
	- If both ythresh and t_ythresh = 0 then luma is not processed at all (speed gain).
	- idem for chroma
